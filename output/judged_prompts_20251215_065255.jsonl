This may help in structured representation if the computational basis is reformulated.\n   ```macaulay2\n   J = ideal(x^2+y^2+z^2);\n   gb = gb J;\n   monomialsInDegree4 = gens gb;\n   ```", "references": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial - Monomial defined in mathematics.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial - Explains degree of a polynomial."], "tool_events": [], "judge": {"decision": "fail", "score": 0.3, "rationale": "The answer does not correctly address the question. While it mentions three methods for generating monomials of degree 4, only the first method using the `monomials` function is correct as it directly achieves the goal. The second method inaccurately lists specific monomials without a general method to find all degree 4 monomials, and the third method incorrectly implies extracting monomials from a Gröbner basis based on an unrelated ideal.
